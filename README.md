# storytree
Overview: StoryTree is a prototype visualization system created for a research project Thinking in stories (Research > Thinking in stories). 
It is a web based system, which has two versions, 'Narrative version' that implements narrative structure and 'Hierarchical list version' 
that implements hierarchical list structure.  
Both versions support literature review process by allowing users to capture intermediate literature details in the visual form 
(either in the narrative or hierarchical list structure). The system also provides means to organize these captured details to generate 
a summary report.  This system is being used during comparative study of the above mentioned research to understand how use of each 
structure during literature review process affects quality of synthesized knowledge.
